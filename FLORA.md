## Orchid care

### Maxillaria juergensii
<a href="http://imgur.com/p21V4XT"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/p21V4XT.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

**Temperature**:	The bulk of the species do very well under intermediate temperatures (55F nights/85F days). Those species from high elevations will require cooler temperatures while those from hot lowlands will require warmer conditions.

**Light**:	Most species respond well under bright light but no direct sun. Conditions similar to those for cattleyas.

**Water-Humidity**:	Most species should be watered year round. They should be watered thoroughly and then allowed to nearly dry before watering again. Since the majority of species come from humid or cloud forests, humidity should be maintained at 40-70% year round.

**Fertilizer**:	Use a dilute, one-quarter to one-half strength orchid fertilizer about twice monthly during the growing season.

**Potting**:	Many species are intolerant of being disturbed so a well-drained epiphyte potting medium should be chosen. Repotting should take place only when new growth AND new roots are visible.

### Scaphosepalum breve
<a href="http://imgur.com/cJuxAqx"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cJuxAqx.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" height=400/></a>

**Temperature**:	Intermediate to Cool - Ideal night temperatures between 50F and 65F; daytime temperatures between 60F and 80F.

**Light**:	Bright light with no direct sun.

**Water-Humidity**:	Evenly moist (roots should never completely dry out) with humidity between 60% and 80%.

**Fertilizer**:	Quarter- to half-strength balanced fertilizer weekly; these plants do not have a dormant period, although they tend to produce flushes of growth in the spring with occasional growths emerging throughout the year. Plants are very intolerant of salts, so be sure to flush thoroughly with plain water between fertilizer.

**Potting**:	Plants grow well in plastic pots or in mesh baskets with a well-drained fine mixture. The type of pot used is dependent upon the inflorescence habit. While many are upright, a few are descending in nature and can get hung up inside the pot if not allowed an easy exit. I use a mixture of 2 parts fine bark, 1 part each of medium tree fern, chopped New Zealand sphagnum moss and perlite. If humidity can be kept on the high side (80 %) many do well when mounted on a slab of tree-fern or cork bark; be sure to place a pad of moss around the roots when doing so as this helps

### Mediocalcar decoratum

<a href="http://www.rv-orchidworks.com/orchidtalk/attachments/orchids-other-genera-bloom/49067d1327522606-mediocalcar-decoratum-p1040692.jpg"><img src="http://www.rv-orchidworks.com/orchidtalk/attachments/orchids-other-genera-bloom/49067d1327522606-mediocalcar-decoratum-p1040692.jpg" height=400/></a>

**Temperature**:	Cool to cool/intermediate.

**Light**:	Bright indirect light.

**Water-Humidity**:	Keep moist with high humidity and good air circulation.

**Fertilizer**:	Plants should be fed with a dilute solution of a balanced fertilizer year round.

**Potting**:	In a pot these plants will form mounds but in general they do best mounted on tree fern slabs or other moisture retentive substrate. The roots are thin and wiry and seem best suited to hold the plant to the substrate.

### Masdevallia erinacea

<a href="https://www.orchidsforum.com/attachments/100_3420-jpg.15453/"><img src="https://www.orchidsforum.com/attachments/100_3420-jpg.15453/" height=400/></a>

**Temperature**:	Warm, intermediate to cool depending on the species and its native habit. In this genus it is critically important to know the identity of the plant you are trying to grow. This is your key to accurate culture.

**Light**:	Virtually all species require bright shade to diffuse bright conditions.
Water-Humidity:	All require 40-70% humidity with excellent air movement. All lack pseudobulbs and should not be allowed to dry out completely for any length of time. Many species are sensitive to dissolved salts and excellent water quality is very important.

**Fertilizer**:	Use a dilute, ½ to ¼ strength balanced fertilizer applied about every other week. Flush thoroughly between fertilizer applications to wash away accumulated salts. Plants are intolerant of high salt accumulation.

**Potting**:	Potting can be done at any time of the year except during periods of high temperature as these plants grow continuously. They can be mounted if adequate water and humidity are provided or they can be potting in small pots of rapidly draining water-retentive epiphytic mix such as treefern or a fine firbark, perlite, charcoal mix or sphagnum moss. Clay pots can be used if plants can be watered sufficiently.

### Cyclopogon lindleyanum

**Temperature**:	Minimum temperature 55-60F

**Light**:	Shady

**Water-Humidity**:	Humid condition; do not allow plants to dry off. While not in active growth and after flowering when leaves may die off, decrease water until new growth appears.

**Fertilizer**:	A balanced fertilizer applied monthly.

**Potting**:	Any good, well draining terrestrial mix.
